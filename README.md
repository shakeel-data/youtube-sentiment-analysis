YouTube sentiment comment analysis helps you truly understand how real viewers feel about a video or a brand‚Äîway beyond basic metrics like views and likes. By automatically classifying user comments into positive, neutral, or negative, you get instant, honest feedback about what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt. For content creators and businesses, this analysis highlights which aspects of the content resonate with people and what needs improvement, helping to refine future videos and communication strategy. It can also alert you to customer pain points, product gaps, and audience trends that‚Äôd be nearly impossible to catch by reading every comment manually.

## üìã Project Overview
This project analyzes YouTube comments to understand real viewer sentiment and extract actionable business insights using a dual AI architecture. It combines YouTube Data API v3 for comment extraction with both Hugging Face Transformers and custom TensorFlow neural networks for comprehensive sentiment classification. The system fetches 500 comments, processes them through advanced NLP models, and generates comprehensive visualizations showing positive, negative, and neutral sentiment patterns. Using Gemini AI for intelligent summarization, it transforms raw user feedback into strategic recommendations for content improvement. The analysis includes confidence scoring, comment length correlation, detailed sentiment distribution metrics, and production-ready machine learning models.

This automated approach saves hours of manual analysis while providing professional-grade insights for content creators and businesses. The project demonstrates end-to-end data pipeline development, from API integration to custom neural network training and business intelligence generation.

- Error Handling: Retries on failed requests and gracefully skips unavailable data
- Verification: Displays the first 5 comments as a quick preview
- Storage: Saves all fetched comments for downstream text analysis

üí° Why this matters: Collecting a large, representative sample of comments helps uncover audience sentiment, engagement trends, and recurring feedback patterns.
```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

def get_comments(video_id, api_key, max_results=500):
    """
    Fetches comments for a YouTube video using the Data API v3.
    Paginates through comments up to the specified max_results.
    """
    comments = []

                    maxResults=100
                ).execute()
            else:
                break

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while fetching comments: {e}")
        return comments[:max_results]

    return comments[:max_results]

# Execute with the CORRECT API key
print("Fetching video comments...")
video_comments = get_comments(VIDEOID, GOOGLE_APIKEY, max_results=500)

if video_comments:
    print(f"Successfully fetched {len(video_comments)} comments.")

        print(f"Comment {i+1}: {comment}\n" + "-"*40)
else:
    print("No comments were fetched.")
```

**Console Output:**
>
> --- Sample fetched 5 comments ---
>
> - Comment 1: This shows that you can have all the money in the world and still can't make a single presentation work... Man we miss Steve Jobs.
> - Comment 2: The battery of my Pixel 7 Pro has swollen, even though I have always used my phone carefully. I never overloaded it and usually charged it no more than 85% to maintain battery life.
>
> I have already contacted Google's customer service. They have told me that I should check via an email they sent whether I am eligible for a warranty application or a repair. However, this puts me in a difficult situation, as the employee herself indicated that she does not know what to do in the meantime.
>
> A swollen battery is very dangerous and can cause serious safety risks. Moreover, my entire digital life is on this device, which means that I now have a big problem. All around the world, people have this problem with Google devices, and if I knew that my mobile would have this sort of problem, I would never have bought a Google device in the first place. People, if you are concerned about your safety and your family's, please don't buy anything from this company; buy from a company that is safe and reliable.
