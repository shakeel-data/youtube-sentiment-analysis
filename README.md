YouTube sentiment comment analysis helps you truly understand how real viewers feel about a video or a brand‚Äîway beyond basic metrics like views and likes. By automatically classifying user comments into positive, neutral, or negative, you get instant, honest feedback about what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt. For content creators and businesses, this analysis highlights which aspects of the content resonate with people and what needs improvement, helping to refine future videos and communication strategy. It can also alert you to customer pain points, product gaps, and audience trends that‚Äôd be nearly impossible to catch by reading every comment manually.

## üìã Project Overview
This project analyzes YouTube comments to understand real viewer sentiment and extract actionable business insights. It combines YouTube Data API v3 for comment extraction with Hugging Face Transformers for AI-powered sentiment classification. The system fetches 500 comments, processes them through advanced NLP models, and generates comprehensive visualizations showing positive, negative, and neutral sentiment patterns. Using Gemini AI for intelligent summarization, it transforms raw user feedback into strategic recommendations for content improvement. The analysis includes confidence scoring, comment length correlation, and detailed sentiment distribution metrics. 

This automated approach saves hours of manual analysis while providing professional-grade insights for content creators and businesses. The project demonstrates end-to-end data pipeline development, from API integration to business intelligence generation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Collection**: Fetch video transcripts and 500+ comments using YouTube Data API v3
- **AI Analysis**: Sentiment analysis with 95%+ confidence using transformer models
- **Smart Summarization**: Batch processing with Gemini 2.5 Flash for detailed insights

## 3. üõ†Ô∏è Function Definitions
`get_video_transcript(video_id):` 
Fetches and cleans the transcript of a YouTube video.
- Uses `pytubefix` to grab the English captions.
- Falls back to auto-generated captions if no standard English track is found.
- Parses the raw XML data and returns a single clean text string.

`get_transcript_summary(transcript):` 
Generates a structured summary of the transcript.
- Sends the transcript text to the `Gemini API` for summarization.
- Skips API calls if the transcript is empty.
- Produces a detailed, well-organized summary for quick referen

```python
def get_video_transcript(video_id):
    """
    Fetches the transcript for a YouTube video using its ID.
    It first looks for a manually created English track ('en'),
    then falls back to the auto-generated one ('a.en').
    """
    try:
        yt_url = f"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={video_id}"
        yt = YouTube(yt_url)

        # Attempt to get the standard English caption track
        caption = yt.captions.get_by_language_code('en')

        # Fallback to auto-generated captions if no standard track is found
        if not caption:
            caption = yt.captions.get_by_language_code('a.en')

        # Return empty if no captions are available at all
        if not caption:
             return ""

        # Parse the XML caption data to extract plain text
        xml_captions = caption.xml_captions
        root = ET.fromstring(xml_captions)
        transcript_lines = [elem.text.strip() for elem in root.iter('text') if elem.text]

        # Join all text lines into a single string
        return " ".join(transcript_lines)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while fetching the transcript: {e}")
        return ""
```

```python
def get_transcript_summary(transcript):
    """
    Generates a detailed summary of a given text transcript
    using the configured Gemini model.
    """
    if not transcript:
        return "Transcript is empty, cannot generate summary."

    try:
        # Request a summary from the Gemini API
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gemini-2.5-flash",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert analyst. Provide a detailed summary of this transcript."},

        print(f"An error occurred during summarization: {e}")
        return "Failed to generate summary."
```
## 4. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute Analysis and View Results
This step ties everything together:
- Runs the full analysis pipeline.
- Fetches the transcript using the earlier functions.
- Generates a structured summary.
- Prints the final summary as output.

```python
# Fetch the transcript from the specified video
print("Fetching video transcript...")
video_transcript = get_video_transcript(VIDEOID)

# Check if the transcript was fetched successfully before summarizing
if video_transcript:
    print("Transcript fetched. Now generating summary...")
    # Generate the summary from the fetched transcript
    transcript_summary = get_transcript_summary(video_transcript)
    print("\n--- Video Transcript Summary ---")
    print(transcript_summary)
else:
    print("Could not proceed with summarization as no transcript was found.")
```

**Console Output:**

## üéØ Fetch YouTube Video Comments
This step focuses on gathering real user insights from a YouTube video:
- API Used: YouTube Data API v3
- Pagination: Fetches comments in batches until reaching 500 comments total
- Error Handling: Retries on failed requests and gracefully skips unavailable data
- Verification: Displays the first 5 comments as a quick preview
- Storage: Saves all fetched comments for downstream text analysis

üí° Why this matters: Collecting a large, representative sample of comments helps uncover audience sentiment, engagement trends, and recurring feedback patterns.
```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

def get_comments(video_id, api_key, max_results=500):
    """
    Fetches comments for a YouTube video using the Data API v3.
    Paginates through comments up to the specified max_results.
    """
    comments = []
    try:
        youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=api_key)

            part="snippet",
            videoId=video_id,
            textFormat="plainText",
            maxResults=100
        ).execute()

        while response and len(comments) < max_results:
            for item in response['items']:
                comment = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['textDisplay']
                comments.append(comment)

            if 'nextPageToken' in response and len(comments) < max_results:

                    part="snippet",
                    videoId=video_id,
                    pageToken=response['nextPageToken'],
                    maxResults=100
                ).execute()
            else:
                break

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while fetching comments: {e}")
        return comments[:max_results]

    return comments[:max_results]

# Execute with the CORRECT API key
print("Fetching video comments...")
video_comments = get_comments(VIDEOID, GOOGLE_APIKEY, max_results=500)

if video_comments:
    print(f"Successfully fetched {len(video_comments)} comments.")

    # Display first 5 comments as sample

        print(f"Comment {i+1}: {comment}\n" + "-"*40)
else:
    print("No comments were fetched.")
```

**Console Output:**
>
> --- Sample fetched 5 comments ---
>
> - Comment 1: This shows that you can have all the money in the world and still can't make a single presentation work... Man we miss Steve Jobs.
> - Comment 2: The battery of my Pixel 7 Pro has swollen, even though I have always used my phone carefully. I never overloaded it and usually charged it no more than 85% to maintain battery life.
>
> I have already contacted Google's customer service. They have told me that I should check via an email they sent whether I am eligible for a warranty application or a repair. However, this puts me in a difficult situation, as the employee herself indicated that she does not know what to do in the meantime.
>
> A swollen battery is very dangerous and can cause serious safety risks. Moreover, my entire digital life is on this device, which means that I now have a big problem. All around the world, people have this problem with Google devices, and if I knew that my mobile would have this sort of problem, I would never have bought a Google device in the first place. People, if you are concerned about your safety and your family's, please don't buy anything from this company; buy from a company that is safe and reliable.
